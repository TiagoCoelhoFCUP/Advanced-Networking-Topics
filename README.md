## Test Network Built Under IPFS
The purpose of this project was first to expose a new paradigm for addressing content on the Internet known as Information Centric Networks.
We begin by describing the operation of this technology at a high level, explain its importance in today's Internet, and to conclude, we share some framework swhich we consider relevant to implement this innovative principle.

Later, as a continuation of the previous research we explored a technology that implements the principles of ICNs, called IPFS. Based on the GNS3 utility, a topology was assembeled with several virtual machines that worked as peers in our network (or, more appropriately, in our IPFS swarm), in order to study the protocol stack that supports it, also identifying some characteristics that make it an NCI.

In this lab work, we explore the main features of the ICNs, verifying that they are implemented, or minimally replicable by IPFS. In order to achieve this goal, we use several practical examples to illustrate the operation of ICNs, and address some alternatives to functionalities that are not yet present in IPFS. Throughout our work, we also provide a nuance of the protocols that make up the IPFS, and their mode of operation.

The IPFS Network Topology is expalined by the picture bellow:
